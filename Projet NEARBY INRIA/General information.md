==Motivation ==: use of BCI outside of the lab : barely used due to poor reliability 
=> Inria + DFKI (German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence) : build open EEG-BCI database and algorithm of Deep Learning

2 applications : Human-Robot collaboration + exoskeleton control 

Poor reliability causes  : 
- noise-sensitivity
- variability 
	- between users
	- within users : user state, electrode positions and impedance, context, learning, change control strategy

2 types of paradigm : 
- motor BCI 
- [[Speech BCIs]] : overt and covert speech 

==Context ==

*Motor BCI*
- most study on single u ser and single session context 
- some about cross session or cross user but not both 
=> here between user, multiple within user and noise 

due to lack of database 
=> 60 subjects with multiple sessions, but only user or session on factor of variability 

*Speech BCI*
Less datasets
Not study with large-scale recording of variability 

Summary : existing dataset who cover variability and noise are not sufficient 
=> large scale study with motor and speech BCI with explicit between user variability, within user variability and noise 
=> based on this dataset : AI algorithms 

==Open EEG BCI database== 

different conditions 
- shielded conditions, controlled setups lab to 2 out-of-the-labs condition 
- effect of different types of electrode : gel, water and dry electrodes

within a session 
- meta data (physical, mental condition or environmental condition) : stress and fatigue 
- both motor and speech BCI

- preparation of finding participants at a early stage of the project to assure the number 

goal : at least 100 participants in 12 sessions 

Organisation in Work Package 

==Expected impacts==
Scientific : large EEG datasets
Technological : demonstrator 
Societal : more robust BCI
