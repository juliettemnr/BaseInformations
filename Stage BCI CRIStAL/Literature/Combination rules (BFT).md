==Dempster's rule of combination== : 
 verify mathematical rules : commutativity and associativity 
*$$ m(A)= \frac{1}{1-K}m_i(B)*m_j(C) \forall A\subseteq\Theta $$
K : conflict between mi and mj : global conflict of combination 
$$K=m_\oplus(ø)=\sum_{B\cap C = ø} m_{i(B)}* m_j(C)$$
=> when they are high conflicts between BOE : can not be used since counterintuituve behaviors will generate

if K=0 : no conflicts occurs 
K=1 : no defined because two beliefs totally in contradiction

==Yager's rule== : conflict mass transferred to the frame of discernment  (Yager, 1988)

==Dubois and Prade's rule== : combined mass result from the pair of focal elements B and C transferred to subset B∩C if B∩C≠ ø and and subset BUC if B∩C≠ ø  (Dubois and Prade, 1988)
=> allow resoleve highly conflicting source
=> not associative 
=> not solve problem on unreliable source

==Smet's rule== : conflict is stored  in the belief mass given to empty set and belief mass is not normalized (Smet, 1990)
=> useful for combination only when frame of discernment is not exhaustive
=> not unreliability 

==Murphy (2000)== : average rule where belief mass of a subset A⊆Θ provided by independent source are averaged to determine the global belief mass on A 

average rule of Murphy $$ m(A)=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}m_{i(A)} $$ for all A⊆Θ  and A ≠ ø
=> not adequate to high conflict 

proposed another rule to incorporate average to Dempster's rule 

=> recommended in cases where the objective is to preserve the opinion of the majority when one source contradicts with several other sources that are consistent (Liu, 2006)
