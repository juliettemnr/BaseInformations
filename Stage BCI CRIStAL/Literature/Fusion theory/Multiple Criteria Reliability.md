**First class : imperfection of information provided by each sensor 

==Contradiction (strife)==
non-zero degrees of belief are allocated to disjoint subsets of a universal set 
=> element of interest cannot belong to only one or several disjoint subsets of the universal set 

$$ St(m)=-\sum_{A\in F}m(A)Log_{2}[\sum_{B\in F}m(B)(|A∩B|/|A|)] $$

- St(m)=0, if ζ contient m(A)=1 : no contradiction
- Max St(m)=Log2|Θ| : uniquely for uniformly distributed measure : BOE totally dissonant 
- Most conflicting BOE : distributing the masses of proba among the max number of disjoint subsets 

==Imprecision (non-specificity)==
degree of non-specificity 
the larger the subset is, the less specific the characterization is
$$ I(m)=\sum_{A\in F}m(A)* Log_2[|A|] $$
I(m)=0 if every singleton is a probability 
=> probability is the maximally precise statement 

==Uncertainty (ambiguity)==

$$ Au(m)= Max_{Bel}[-\sum_{\theta_{i}\in \Theta}p_{\theta_i}Log_{2}p_{\theta_i}] $$
Amount of uncertainty : P.4
