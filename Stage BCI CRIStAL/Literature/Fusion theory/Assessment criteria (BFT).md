*Frikha et Moalla, 2015 : 

==Single criterion== to estimate reliability of sensors : 
- quality of information 
- non-specificity
- uncertainty
- conflict between sensors

Martin et al 2008 : 
estimation of BOE based on distance of evidence 

Liu et al 2011 : new dissimilarity measure to assess discounting factors 

Deng et al 2004 and Chen et al 2005 : similarity to determine weights 

=> not reliable : mono criteria is not enough to reflect reality 

==Multiple criteria== : 

**First class : imperfection of information provided by each sensor 

[[./Multiple Criteria Reliability|Multiple Criteria Reliability]]

Contradiction, imprecision and amount of uncertainty are criterion to minimize.

**Second class : conflict between sensors BOE 

[[./Multiple Criteria Conflict|Multiple Criteria Conflict]]

Conflict measure, dissimilarity and disparity are criterion to minimize.
