First introduced by Saaty 1980

==Definition== (Saaty, 1980) :  It is a multi-criteria decision-making method that uses hierarchic or network structures to represent a decision-making problem and develops priorities for the alternatives based on the decision maker judgments throughout the system.

*Frikha et Moalla, 2015 : 

Starts from a binary comparison matrices to assess weight vector 

Five steps : 

- decompose decision problem into hierarchical structure : decision goal, alternatives, criteria and sub-criteria 
- evaluate elements of hierarchy by comparing them in pairs 
- determine the relative importance (priority or weight) of each hierarchical structure element (criterion) from pairwise matrices : normalize matrix, and create a vector of weight 
- 


Major advantage : ability to decompose : decision problem is decomposed in sub problems easier to analyzed and independent analysis 

Drawback : 
- lot of subjectivity
