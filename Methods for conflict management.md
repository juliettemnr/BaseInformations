- Use of a discounting operation before combining to handle conflicting evidence combination and consider sensor reliability (voir rÃ©f p.2)

- Method Murphy (2000) : pas tout compris p.2

- Concept of weights of pieces

- single criterion : 
	- distance of evidence or similarity 
	- not reliable : mono criteria is not enough to reflect reality 

Conflict is not the only parameter, sensor reading imperfection must be taking into account also : multiple criteria
