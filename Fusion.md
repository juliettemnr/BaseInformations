*Frikha et Moalla, 2015, Analytic hierarchy process for multi-sensor data fusion based on belief function theory*

Data from multiple source : usually imperfect : imprecise, uncertain and conflicting => problem of fusion 

Most fusion system : assume that all sensors are reliable
=> but performance of fusion : dependant on [[./Reliability of sensors|Reliability of sensors]]

Tools for modeling and fusing multi-sensor pieces : [[./Belief function theory|Belief function theory]].
